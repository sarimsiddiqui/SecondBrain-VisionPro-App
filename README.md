# SecondBrain VisionPro App

This Swift productivity application was made for the Apple VisionPro. 


Understanding that productivity can vary between individuals, we explored different aspects of performance boosters. In our first section of the app, we created a customizable Pomodoro timer, which based on research is one of the most popular tools for productivity. This would enable users to track time in their virtual space easily and effectively. This was a perfect starting point for us to explore the foundations of building a VisionPro app.

Taking a step further into the development process, we started to look at spatial audio and created a tab for users to immerse themselves in 3D white noise to help them focus. This section of the application helped us understand the engineering concepts behind Apple’s spatial audio and how to turn regular sounds into an immersive experience.

The last part of the development process was all about defining a new generation of productivity, which we called the “productivity space.” This element allows users to transform their workspace into their personal productivity world. We designed the application to turn half of the user's room into a scenic environment to explore, while the other half would remain their original workspace. This means that instead of being distracted by elements around the user, they can instead place themselves in a variety of settings that would help them control their productivity. This element was the most challenging, but rewarding to create. It included creating 3D renders of multiple environments using Blender, transforming these objects for the Reality Composer Pro, and integrating the scene into the application.
